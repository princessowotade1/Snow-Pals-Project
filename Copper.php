        <h4 id="s_heading">Snow Biking</h4>
        <p><img class="activities__img" src="img/copbik.png">With roughly 4-inch-wide tires, snow bikes put more surface area on the ground to keep you stable in powder, slick or bumpy conditions and let you cruise through fresh snow. Snow biking is a great activity if you're an avid mountain biker that would like to keep biking through the winter, it's also great for new mountain bikers because of the snow bike's great stability.

        <h4 id="s_heading">Ice Fishing</h4>
        <p><img class="activities__img" src="img/copfish.jpg">With over 5 square miles of surface area, it is hard to believe that Lake Dillon freezes at all!
