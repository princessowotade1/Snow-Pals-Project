        <p><img class="activities__img" src="img/alta_shoe.jpg">A great way to get out in Little Cottonwood Canyon is and enjoy a peaceful day on the snow and in the woods is Alta Snowshoeing. Snowshoeing at Alta is allowed on the Summer Road, starting near the Albion Base area. The Summer Road features a gradual groomed slope up into the Grizzly Gulch area of the Little Cottonwood Canyon backcountry, offering beautiful views the further you trek up towards the ridgeline.

        <h4 id="s_heading">Skiing</h4>
        <p><img class="activities__img" src="img/alta_ski.jpg">Unfortunately, snowboarding is not allowed at the Alta Ski Resort. Fortunately, Nestled near the top of one of Utah's best canyons, Alta is a storied paradise for skiers. Even riders leave their boards at home for a chance at the 2,200+ acres of Alta's renowned slopes featuring 116 runs. Alta is known around the globe for its powder skiing. With an annual snowfall average of 547” powder days are a way of life here. It’s a magnetic way of life that draws the same employees and guests back to Alta’s community each winter. Come for the skiing. Stay for the skiing.

        <p><img class="activities__img" src="img/alta_cat.webp">Alta Resort offers guided snowcat skiing in Grizzly Gulch for advanced to expert riders via a 5 run package. The terrain area is only small (325 acres), but the chances of skiing untracked powder are much higher than in the resort.
