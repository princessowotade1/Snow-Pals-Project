        <p><img class="activities__img" src="img/breckdog.png">Take an exhilarating dog sledding ride through the backcountry in Breckenridge and experience the Rocky Mountains in a whole new way.Two riders are pulled in a sled behind a pack of Siberian Huskies through terrain that is difficult to access by foot, skis or snowmobiles. About 6 to 10 dogs are lined up in front of the sleds and two riders take turn mushing, or driving the sled, while the second rider gets to sit back and take in the views and capture photos to look back on.
