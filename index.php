        <h3>About Us:</h3>
        <p>Snow Pals was created to connect people with similar outdoor hobbies.
            Maybe you love skiing but you're new to an area or you would like to meet more people in your skill level.
            Our website, Snow Pals, can be used by anyone with an interest in our available activities.
            These currently include skiing and snowboarding at our five featured locations.
            Upon registration you'll be asked a series of questions such as: your areas of interest, accessible
            locations, and your current skill level.
            Afterward, you will be able to access a list of several users with similar interests. Don't like any of your
            recommendations?
            No problem, you can hit a refresh button to update your list with several new matches.
            Once you have found someone you are interested in, you are able to view their profile.
            A short biography will be available as well as a messaging option.
            Users will be able to access all previous messages while logged in.
